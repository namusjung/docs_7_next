# Introduction

The 7en Platform API is designed around REST. Our API features predictable resource-oriented URLs, accepts form-encoded and JSON request bodies, returns JSON-encoded responses, and adheres to standard HTTP response codes, authentication, and verbs. The API supports a variety of operations including user authentication, team management, AI agent configuration, knowledge base management, and chat session handling. You can interact with the API in a secure and efficient manner to build powerful applications for your business or organization.
