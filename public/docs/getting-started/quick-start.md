# Quick Start Guide

Welcome to 7en, the intelligent AI platform that transforms your existing data into active support agents. 7en reads your URLs, documents, and knowledge base to respond to customer queries instantly—just like a real team member.

Follow these 5 steps to build, train, and deploy your first AI agent.

{% section id="step-1" title="Step 1: Build Your Agent" %}

Sign up for a free [7en.ai](https://app.7en.ai) account and determine the role your AI needs to fill. 7en offers two distinct agent types:

**Chatbot** (Frontline Support): Best for real-time conversations, sales, and support. It allows for human handoff, ticket escalation, and agent-to-agent transfers.

**Assistant** (Knowledge Companion): Best for content-heavy environments like API docs or help centers. It focuses purely on delivering accurate answers from your content without escalation features.

{% section id="step-2" title="Step 2: Add Your Knowledge Base" %}

Your agent is only as smart as the data you give it. Navigate to the Knowledge Sources tab to begin training:

**Add Sources**: Click to add content via:
- **Website**: Crawl your entire site or specific URLs.
- **Documents**: Upload PDFs, manuals, or policy files.
- **Plain Text**: Paste FAQs or raw text directly.
- **Integrations**: Connect Google Drive to import files directly from the cloud.

**Train**: After adding your sources, you must click the Train Agent button. This processes the data and updates the agent's brain.

{% section id="step-3" title="Step 3: Configure Your Agent" %}

Once your data is ready, navigate to the side panel to customize how your agent looks, thinks, and behaves.

**Model Settings**: Adjust the underlying AI parameters to fine-tune how the model processes information.

**Appearance**: Branding is key. Customize the chat widget’s color scheme, logo, and display name to seamlessly blend with your website.

**Guidelines**: Define the agent's personality. Select a Persona Type (e.g., Sales Agent), customize the System Prompt, and set strict Do's and Don'ts to ensure every response is accurate and on-brand.

{% section id="step-4" title="Step 4: Configure Escalation" %}

If you are building a Chatbot, configure the Escalation settings to handle queries the AI cannot answer.

**Human Handoff**: Enable this to let users request a real person.

**Ticketing**: Connect to Zoho, Zendesk, or Freshdesk to automatically log unresolved queries as tickets.

**Email**: Alternatively, have the bot email chat transcripts to your support inbox.

{% /section %}

{% section id="step-5" title="Step 5: Integrate & Deploy" %}

Once trained, make your agent accessible to your users via the Chat Integration section.

**Web Widget**: Embed the chat window directly on your website.

**Messaging Apps**: Enable channels like Slack, WhatsApp, Instagram, or Messenger with a single click.

**Quick Suggestions**: Set up preset questions (e.g., "What is your pricing?") to help users start the conversation effortlessly.
