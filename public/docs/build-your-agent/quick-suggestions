{% section id="quick-suggestions" title="Quick Suggestions" %}

The Quick Suggestions section allows you to configure preset questions that appear as clickable buttons (conversation starters) when a user opens the chat widget. These suggestions guide users toward common topics and reduce the friction of typing out full queries manually.

### Configuration Fields

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **Suggestion Text** | The specific question or prompt text that will appear inside the clickable chip. | `What are your services?` |
| **Add Suggestion** | A button to create a new entry in the list. You can add multiple suggestions to cover different topics. | `+ Add Suggestion` |
| **Remove (X)** | Allows you to delete an existing suggestion from the list if it is no longer relevant. | `(X icon)` |

### Feature Overview

* **Quick Suggestions** serve as "icebreakers" between the user and the AI.
* **Visual Placement:** They appear immediately above the text input field in the chat interface.
* **Interaction:** When a user clicks a suggestion, that text is immediately sent as a message, triggering the AI's response.
* **Default Behavior:** If no suggestions are configured, the chat interface will simply show the welcome message and a blank input field.

| Category | Best Practice |
|----------|---------------|
| **Keep it Short and Punchy** | Space is limited, especially on mobile. Keep suggestions under 5–7 words. |
| | **Bad:** "Can you please tell me about how much your different subscription plans cost?" |
| | **Good:** "What is your pricing?" |
| **Focus on High-Intent Topics** | Use your FAQs to determine what goes here. Prioritize topics like "Pricing" or "Support" that 80% of users ask about. |
| **Guide the User Journey** | Use suggestions to show users what the bot is capable of (e.g., if your bot can track orders, add a "Track my order" suggestion). |
